# 🏥 Emergency Hospital Finder & Waiting Time Predictor

## 📌 Project Description
Emergency Hospital Finder is a healthcare assistance system designed to help users quickly identify nearby hospitals during medical emergencies. The platform displays important hospital details such as estimated waiting time, queue length, available doctors, available beds, and distance, enabling faster and informed decision-making.

The backend uses a machine learning model trained on hospital load parameters to predict waiting time, while the frontend provides a simple and user-friendly interface to view hospital information.

This project was developed as part of a hackathon to address delays in emergency hospital admissions.
